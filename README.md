This code goes along with the blog post __The Complete Guide to Full Stack Development with Supabase and Next.js__ published [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-development-with-supabas/)

To get started with this project, follow these steps.

1. Create a new project in the [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) dashboard

2. Click on __SQL__ in the left menu, and execute the following SQL query:

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  user_email text,
  title text,
  content text,
  inserted_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

alter table posts enable row level security;

create policy "Individuals can create posts." on posts for
    insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Individuals can update their own posts." on posts for
    update using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Individuals can delete their own posts." on posts for
    delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Posts are public." on posts for
    select using ( true );
```
